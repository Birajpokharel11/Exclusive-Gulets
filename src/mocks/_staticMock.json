Lying on a sun-warmed deck at night watching the glittering stars, you are guaranteed to have a good show in the unpolluted night sky theater!</p>\r\n",

Gulets are provisioned early in the morning by our local teams, using only local produce fresh ingredients which are mostly organic and all meals are prepared by your very own chef on-board for the ultimate alfresco dining experience. Please be sure to inform us of any special dietary requirements you may have, so the chef can prepare accordingly.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nThere is always a selection of appetizers like stuffed peppers, pan fried aubergines and artichokes. The ancient alluvial river valleys between the high mountains grow a remarkable range of salads, vegetables and fruits. Pulses are traditionally cooked on slow heat in extra virgin olive oil and they are the favourites of vegetarians.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nSucculent fresh fish and other seafood is sometimes caught by the crew or the guests themselves or bought from local fishermen who come along when they have a catch to sell. For meat lovers lamb, beef or free-range chicken is seasoned with fresh herbs like basil, oregano, tarragon, thyme and paprika and cooked on a barbecue to capture all the flavours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before you embark upon your luxury charter, you and your guests will be asked to complete a preference sheet which will itemise in detail any dietary requirements, food allergies and medical conditions that the crew should be made aware of prior to departure. Be as detailed as you can be, if you are on a strict diet, mention it, if you only like white chocolate, put it down as the crew will then use this sheet to familiarise themselves with your likes, dislikes and how you like to dine. Be completely honest and maybe even adventurous and you will not be disappointed. Once this preference sheet has been reviewed by the crew, you can rest assured that the cuisine on-board your yacht charter will be nothing less than perfect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Whether you prefer alfresco lunches, formal dining, beach picnics&nbsp;or sundeck snacking, our on board Chef will cater to your every gastronomic delight, from beautifully assembled four course meals to delicious snacks and nibbles, there is no doubt that your food experience will be nothing but delightful.</h4>\r\n\r\n<h4>&nbsp;</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Remember, chefs will not have access to large supplies of ingredients once the yacht has set sail and although it may be possible to source ingredients locally; this is dependent on your charter destination. Be sure to mention if you have a special occasion whilst on board as yacht charter crews love to host a party. From pirate themed nights to decadent dinner parties, what better way to celebrate than with a feast of culinary delights alongside your favourite people with a slice of personalised birthday cake for dessert? From delectable beach picnics to delicious hors d&#39;oeuvres your on board chef can prepare astounding meals which are perfectly tailored to your own personal preferences, bon appetit!</p>\r\n",
